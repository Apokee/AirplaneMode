##### New
- Added setting to disable Application Launcher (stock toolbar) button.

## v0.3.0
##### New
- Use stock Application Launcher.
- Control mode is persisted with command pods, probe cores, and docking ports. The mode used is determined by whichever
  part is selected with the *Control From Here* button.
- Control mode is automatically selected for new parts in the editor. Parts in the VAB are placed in Rocket mode and
  parts in the SPH are placed in Plane mode.

##### Changes
- Renamed from "Aeroplane Mode" to "Plane Mode".
- Settings configuration has been changed slightly and toggle and hold keys have both been defaulted to None rather
  than ScrollLock and Home.

##### Fixes
- Handle switching vessels better.
