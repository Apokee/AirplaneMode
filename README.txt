OVERVIEW
========

This small plugin allows you to swap your roll and yaw axes in flight. This is a minor fix for joystick 	users like myself who found some of the other workarounds unweildy.

The default keyboard commands are:

Hit the 'Scroll Lock' key to toggle control modes, or press and hold the 'Home' key to temporarily change control mode.

These keys can be rebound, and the plugin supports blizzy's toolbar if you have it installed, adding a small icon that can be clicked to toggle modes.


SETUP
=====

1) Place the the 'AeroplaneMode' directory in your copy of KSP's GameData folder.

2) If you want to change the keybindings, open 'settings.cfg' in a text editor, and change the "primary = ... " entry for each command, to your prefered key. A list of key codes can be found here: Http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html

3) If you'd like pitch control to be reveresd when switching modes change "pitch_invert = false" to true.

3) In KSP's control settings menu, bind your joystick axes the way you would like them to work when flying rockets.

4) OPtional: bind the keys you set in step 2, to buttons on your joystick.
